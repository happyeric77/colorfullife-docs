# git commit --amend --no-edit

We are going to talk about the `git commit` option `--amend --no-edit` in this article.

It is particularly useful when you want to add some changes to the last commit without changing the commit message.

## --amend

The `--amend` option allows you to modify the last commit.

## --no-edit

It tells Git that you don't want to change the commit message.

:::caution

Since the commit has been modified, the commit hash will also change.
