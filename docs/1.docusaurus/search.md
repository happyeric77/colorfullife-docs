From the email, we get the following information:

1. `appId`
2. `apiKey`
3. `indexName`

Then we can add the following code to `docusaurus.config.js`

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  themeConfig:
    /** @type {import('@docusaurus/preset-classic').ThemeConfig} */
    ({
      // ...
      algolia: {
        appId: "appId",
        apiKey: "apiKey",
        indexName: "indexName",
      },
    }),
  // ...
};
```

There are some other options that we can add to `algolia` object. See [official doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.0.1/search#connecting-algolia) for more details.

Then we can run `yarn start` to see the search bar showing on the top right corner.

If you want to customize the search bar, it provides some options. See [official doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/2.0.1/search#customizing-the-algolia-search-behavior) for more details.
