# Mono Repo with Lerna

<Drawio content={drawIo} page={1} zoom={0.5} editable={true} maxHeight={300} />

Lerna is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

This article will show you how to create a mono repo with Lerna.

## Create a new project

Create a new project with the following command:

```bash
mkdir lerna-example
cd lerna-example

npm init -y
```

## Initialize Lerna

Initialize Lerna with the following command:

```bash
npx lerna init
```

This will create a `lerna.json` file in the root of the project.

## Create a package

Create a new package with the following command:

```bash
npx lerna create @lerna-example/package-1 -y
```

This will create a new folder `packages/package-1` with a `package.json` file.

## Most common commands

Now that we have a mono repo with a package, it helps to manage all npm packages in root `package.json` file and node modules in root `node_modules` folder. So, if we `npm install` a package in root `package.json` file, it will be installed in root `node_modules` folder and all packages in `packages` folder will be able to use it.

To manage the packages, I often use the following commands:

### Run certain npm script in all packages (ex: `build`)

```bash
npx lerna run build
```

### Run npm script in a certain package (ex: `build` in `package-1`)

```bash
npx lerna --scope=@lerna-example/package-1 run build
```

### Publish all packages

To push mono-repository to npm which is the concept of using npm [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope). Meaning it is necessary to create a organization under the account.
After that, you can publish packages to npm with the following command:

```bash
npx lerna publish
```

The command above exectues actually `npx lerna version` and `npx lerna publish from-packages` under the hood.

You can also run it seperately.

If you are using a free tier account, you might come across the following error:

:::warning

```

? Are you sure you want to publish these packages? Yes
lerna info publish Publishing packages to npm...
lerna ERR! E402 You must sign up for private packages

```

The reason is npm treats all packages under the same scope as private packages. So, you either need to upgrade your account to a paid tier or you need to [set `access` to `public`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43007471/how-to-migrate-npm-package-to-an-organization-scope) like below:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```
