# About Me

Hello there! My name is Eric and I'm a blockchain and frontend developer with a passion for exploring new technologies and creating innovative solutions.

After completing my master's degree in business in the UK and working many years as a Business developer of IoT product, I decided to pursue my interest in programming and taught myself how to code. Since then, I've been working on various projects related to blockchain and full-stake development, constantly learning and improving my skills along the way.

I also enjoy the creativity that comes with being a developer. There's a certain satisfaction in taking a client's vision and turning it into a fully functioning application. The ability to create something tangible and meaningful from scratch is incredibly rewarding and keeps me motivated to continue learning and growing as a developer.

In addition to my work in the tech industry, I'm also an avid boxer and enjoy cooking, especially Japanese cuisine. Living in Japan has given me the chance to learn more about the country's culture and traditions, which has been an incredibly enriching experience.
