## Backup home server system

To secure our home server system configuration, we can use Duplicati to backup the system to the cloud storage.

:::warning

The backup files generated by Duplicati can only be restored by Duplicati. If you suffer a catastrophic failure of your system, you will need to

1. Install your operating system (Linux in my case)
2. Install Docker
3. Install Duplicati Docker container

## Install Duplicati Docker container

Since all our home server services docker containers' configurations are mapped to `/opt`, we want to backup the whole `/opt` directory in our home server.

According we will need to map the `/opt` directory to the Duplicati `/source` directory so that Duplicati can backup the `/opt` directory of our home server. (see below `dupliati.volume`)

```bash title="/opt/docker-compose.yaml"

version: '3.0'

services:

  # homeassistant:
  #   container_name: homeassistant
  #   image: "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable"
  #   volumes:
  #     - /opt/homeasistant/config:/config
  #     - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
  #     - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro
  #   restart: unless-stopped
  #   privileged: true
  #   network_mode: host

  duplicati:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/duplicati:latest
    container_name: duplicati-backup
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Asia/Tokyo
    volumes:
      - /opt/duplicati/config:/config
      - /opt:/source
    ports:
      - 8200:8200
    restart: unless-stopped

```

After running `sudo docker compose up -d`, we can access Duplicati from `http://your-home-server-ip:8200` and then using the Web UI to backup/restore our home server system config.

Big thanks to Youtuber Home Automation Guy created this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJqPhYXeulk) to guide through the detailed setup backup process by Duplicati Web UI.

## Embaded Duplicati in Home Assistant

We can also embed Duplicati in Home Assistant navigation panel so that we can manage all our home server services in one place.

```yaml title="/opt/homeassistant/configuration.yaml"
panel_iframe:
  duplicati:
    title: Duplicati
    icon: mdi:backup-restore
    url: http://your-home-server-ip:8200
```
