Using macOS shortcuts with stream deck can be a great way to improve productivity. In this article, we are going to talk about how we can change our slack status just in one click.

## Get the Slack API token

To update our slack status, we will need to firstly [get the slack API token](https://api.slack.com/). You will be able to learn how to get the slack API token from the following reference docs:

1. [English](https://docs.celigo.com/hc/en-us/articles/7140655476507-How-to-create-an-app-and-retrieve-OAuth-token-in-Slack)
2. [Japanese](https://goodlocal.jp/blog/M7p8dmXg)

> Note: #2, it introduces the way to install an stream deck 3rd party plugin. But I don't recommend it since I do not want to put my token in a 3rd party plugin.

There are two api endpoints we are going to use:

1. `users.setPresence`: This endpoint is used to switch between `auto` and `away` status.
2. `users.profile.set`: This endpoint is used to update the status text and emoji.

## Switch between `auto` and `away` status

Here we are going to use `curl` to send a request to the slack API. You can also use other tools like `postman` or `insomnia`.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://slack.com/api/users.setPresence" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-slack-api-key" \
-d '{"presence": "away"}'
```

The last parameter `presence` can be `auto` or `away`. For example, if we set it as `away`, our slack status will be changed to `away` like below:

## Update the status text and emoji

```bash
curl -X POST "https://slack.com/api/users.profile.set" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-slack-api-key" \
-d '{"profile": {"status_text": "unavailable", "status_emoji": "ðŸ“´"}}'
```

The last parameter `status_text` and `status_emoji` can be any string and emoji. For example, if we set it as `unavailable` and `ðŸ“´`, our slack status will be changed to `unavailable` and `ðŸ“´` like below:
